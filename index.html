          <strong>Hi!</strong> I'm Gus.
          <br />
          <br />
          I help local communities design and use collaboration technologies to organize around issues that are
          meaningful to us, like climate change and democracy.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Academic explanation</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Digital technologies like crowdsourcing and peer production tools have increased our potential to address
          social issues like climate change and inequality, but realizing this potential depends on our ability to
          organize around issues that are meaningful to us. While some of this organizing work might happen online
          (e.g., coordinating events, managing participant lists), most of it must happen face-to-face (e.g.,
          deliberation, outreach).
          <br><br>
          I research and design equitable hybrid work collaboration technologies for organizing civic collective actions
          through deliberation, group formation, coaching, and outreach. To do so, I draw on my academic training in
          computer science, psychology, and design as well as theories from learning, political, and management
          sciences. I use both qualitative and quantitative research methods to understand the social processes I study
          to inform the design of and to evaluate the technologies I build.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Background</strong>
          <br><br>
          As a PhD student in the departments of <a href="https://tsb.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Computer
            Science and
            Communication</a> at Northwestern University,
          member of the <a href="https://delta.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">interdisciplinary Delta Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.hci.northwestern.edu/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human-Computer Interaction + Design</a> and <a
            href="https://cogsci.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognitive
            Science Fellow</a>, I
          study how to design, build, and evaluate technologies to increase participation and representation in open
          democracy initiatives, like participatory budgeting. I worked with the City of Evanston (population 78K) to
          implement their first participatory budgeting process, a year-long process where the community generated
          ideas, developed proposals, and voted on how to spend $3M. With the help of 100+ trained and committed
          volunteers, we achieved 8.4% participation (a lot more than the 1-2% national average) and overrepresented
          underrepresented communities in this <a
            href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ILEVANSTON/bulletins/375bbfc" target="_blank">historic civic
            engagement
            process</a>. As part of this process, I studied how
          organized groups formed and grew, how effective outreach was conducted, and how collaboration technologies
          were used and how new technologies might be designed.

          <a href="https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html"
            target="_blank">sustainable development goals</a>, like ending poverty and hunger by 2030, and reaching
          carbon
          neutrality by 2050, we need active and engaged citizens. Some of
          these citizens, like social entrepreneurs, will dedicate their
          entire careers to advancing these goals. I study and design
          technologies to increase civic participation through activism and
          deliberation and to help social entrepreneurs navigate their careers
          through mentorship. <br /><br />
