              In partnership with the City of Evanston, I designed and
              implemented the outreach research program that increased
              participation from 800 to 6,500+ participants and brought 2,000+
              new faces to a pilot participatory budgeting program to allocate
              $3.5M in COVID-relief funds.

                  participatory budgeting program through iterative testing of

                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                  Increased representation to match city's demographics by
                  conducting large-scale survey (8K+ participants) and strategic
                  outreach to underrepresented communities
                </li>
                <li>
